Cloudformation:
YAML template
- resources (S3, EC2, SG) (tags, imageid, userdata)
- parameters (specify resources and use it as reference)
- conditions - will only create the resources if the conditions met, 
- DNSRecords - albs,recordsets
- Outputs - values you can import to other stacks
- mappings - variables

TAM process
- we used windsor workflows to run decks and kick off cloudformation templates (managed by other team)
- under windsor, several yaml/json are deployed that are being pulled in from Git and maintained by devops
- The environment is a dev environments, 1 stack has several nodes and launch templates for ec2 instances running on linux
- the application is called MultiTenant which can cater multiple customers (company perse) in one stack and running on ASG
- we do maintain the changes on parameters, update the versions and stacks, troubleshoot issues concerning ASG, EC2, DNS recordsets
